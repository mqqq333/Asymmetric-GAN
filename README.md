## üí° Overview

**Asymmetric-GAN** is a cutting-edge project focused on the study of **brain hemisphere asymmetry** and its impact on cognitive functions. The project utilizes **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to model and analyze the interaction between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. By reconstructing one hemisphere using the data from the opposite hemisphere, the aim is to uncover shared and unique functional regions between the hemispheres, contributing new insights into the study of **hemispheric lateralization**.

This research explores the global structural relationships of the brain's hemispheres, breaking away from traditional methods that rely solely on homotopic cortical region comparisons. By leveraging **GANs**, the project enhances our understanding of brain hemisphere specialization, introducing a concept known as **global hemispheric specificity**.

The model evaluation uses two key metrics‚Äî**absolute voxel distance (ANS)** and **relative voxel distance (RNS)**‚Äîto assess the hemispheric asymmetry, validated through **reliability and validity testing** to ensure biological accuracy. This project offers new perspectives on hemispheric lateralization and opens doors for future cognitive neuroscience research.
